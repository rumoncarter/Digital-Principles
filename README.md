The following are offered as a DRAFT set of principles to guide the work and behaviour of the Digital BC community.

These principles have been drafted by BC's Chief Digital Officer, borrowing heavily from principles produced by other public jurisdictions. The intent is that they be moved to their own repository on https://github.com/bcgov/, for eventual inclusion on https://digital.gov.bc.ca/. 

## Draft Principles for Digital BC

### 1.       Deliver impact for British Columbians
Government exists to improve peoples’ lives. Digital services should support this goal. Focus on citizens’ needs; build services for outcomes rather than outputs; deliver sustainable services through judicious use of public resources.

### 2.       Design with people
Deliver simple, effective products and services that improve lives, doing so via human-centered design practices with the people who will actually use the product or service.

### 3.       Embed inclusion
Apply the highest standards of accessibility, inclusion and ethics at every stage of product and service design, development and delivery.

### 4.       Improve constantly
Iterate and improve products and services frequently to support learning and innovation; use modern tools and approaches; be flexible to change, accepting ongoing user feedback; test early and often; start small and scale up.

### 5.       Work in the open
Adopt open standards to facilitate interoperability and scalability; work in the open to collaborate, co-design and co-create with users; release open data and APIs; default towards open licenses, open and interoperable standards, open-source code and open, cross-sector collaboration.

### 6.       Take an ecosystem approach
Design and deliver solutions that are forward-thinking, adaptable and scalable; reuse before re-creating; support common components and interoperability.

### 7.       Act as trusted information stewards
Manage information, including data, as a public asset in accordance with its value; apply rigour around decision-making, using data to take an evidence-based approach.

### 8.       Manage risks
Respect security, privacy and ethics, balancing them with the imperative for swift action; design risk mitigation strategies to be clear and to support iteration and agile delivery.

### 9.       Build capacity
Empower all public servants to deliver excellent digital services; support teams, providing them with technology, tools and training; encourage innovation and controlled experimentation; build an organizational culture that supports constant learning.

### 10.   Be culturally & historically aware
Acknowledge the historical relationships, inequity, trauma, and discrimination created by government; work in the spirit of reconciliation and B.C.’s Draft Principles that guide our relationship with Indigenous peoples.
